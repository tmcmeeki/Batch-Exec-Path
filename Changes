Revision history for Perl extension Batch::Exec::Path.

DEFECTS:
	- on cygwin, "/tmp" resolves as follows: $ cygpath -w /tmp
		C:\cygwin64\tmp (rather than: c:\Users\jbloggs\cygwin\tmp)
	- may need to have a more reliable temp directory, e.g. 
		cygwin:  TMP=/tmp TEMP=/tmp
		dos: TEMP=C:\Users\tmcme\AppData\Local\Temp TMP=C:\Users\tmcme\AppData\Local\Temp
		also: /cygdrive/c/Windows/Temp (normally privileged access)
		and WSL and linux are just /tmp

TO-DO:
	- consider move to parent: cat_re, cat_str, default, is_known, is_unknown, Id
	- consider moving the DN_DIST_WSL variable into the parent wsl_dist() method.
	- cleanup all the commented out libraries/includes
	- change all logwarn to warn messages
	- consider how a cygroot might be determined (very difficult!)

1.4
	- removed the exists attribute as it cannot be reliably determined,
	  plus network shares checks impact performance.
	- new adapt method is a convenience wrapper where the to-type 
	  defaults to that of the current platform.
	- unit testing of escape() and removal of shellify attribute.
	- removed the "GOT HERE" statements in the convert_volumes() method.
	- added some default attributes, e.g. for DN_DIST_WSL(distro) and DN_DRIVE_DFL(dosdrive)
	  which are highly contrived assumptions, which may need to be overridden.
	- fixed the ordering of test plan, which was erroneously placed after use_ok

1.3
	- support for numeric IPs in a server address (UNC/CIFS or NFS)
	- moved to parent class: Id, dump_nice (now just dump), winuser
	- removed the redundant "mount" attribute and disabled "root" attribute
	- lov registration for key attributes: abs, homed, hybrid, type, unc.
	- added convert_home() and convert_volumes() methods to simplify convert()
	- allow passing of user into the home() method and added the homes() method.
	- added set() method correlating to default() which now uses LoV functionality
	- significant increase in convert() scenarios.

1.2
	- moved to parent class: whoami, winuser, dump_nice (as "dump")
	- removed the mount attribute
	- added methods: convert, homes.
	- modified the home method to allow specification of username
	- added unit testing for: is_known, is_unknown
