Revision history for Perl extension Batch::Exec::Path.

TO-DO:
	- consider move to parent: cat_re, cat_str, default, is_known, is_unknown, Id
	- Too late to run INIT block at ../Batch-Exec/lib/Batch/Exec.pm line 186.
	- consider adding some default attributes, e.g. for DN_DIST_WSL and DN_DRIVE_DFL
	  which are highly contrived assumptions.
	- monitor and remove the "GOT HERE" statements in the convert_volumes() method.
	- consider moving the DN_DIST_WSL variable into the parent wsl_dist() method.
	- cleanup all the commented out libraries/includes
	- change all logwarn to warn messages

1.3
	- support for numeric IPs in a server address (UNC/CIFS or NFS)
	- moved to parent class: Id, dump_nice (now just dump), winuser
	- removed the redundant "mount" attribute and disabled "root" attribute
	- lov registration for key attributes: abs, homed, hybrid, type, unc.
	- added convert_home() and convert_volumes() methods to simplify convert()
